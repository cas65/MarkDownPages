Eutrophication
==============
Eutrophication is the process where a body of water like a lake or river becomes overly enriched with nutrients specifically nitrogen and phosphorus. It it often due to runoff from agriculture, wastewater, or urban areas and there are two types of eutrophication.

 Natural Eutrophication 
 ---------------------
 Natural eutrophication is a gradual process that happens over centuries as nutrient rich sediments accumulate causing plant growth to increase
 
 Cultural Eutrophication
 ----------------------
 Cultural Eutrophication id a faster process driven by human activity often due to agriculteral runoff, sewage discharge, and industrial pollution.
