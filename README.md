Eutrophication
==============
Eutrophication is the process where a body of water like a lake or river becomes overly enriched with nutrients particularly nitrogen and phosphorus. It it often due to runoff from agriculture, wastewater, or urban areas and there are two types of eutrophication.

 Natural Eutrophication 
 ---------------------
 Natural eutrophication is a gradual process that happens over centuries as nutrient rich sediments accumulate causing plant growth to increase
 
 Cultural Eutrophication
 ----------------------
 Cultural Eutrophication id a faster process driven by human activity often due to agriculteral runoff, sewage discharge, and industrial pollution.

 List of common Chemicals that cause eutrophication 
 --------------------------------------------------
 - Nitrates: commonly found in agriculteral fertilizers
 - Phosphates: aslo found in fertilizers as well as detergents and sewage
 - Ammonium: form of nitrogen in fertilizers and wastwater
 - Nitrites: Produced by the decomposition of organic matter
 - Urea: used as a fertilizer
 - Potassium: found in fertlizers
 - Sulfates: often in industrial waste
